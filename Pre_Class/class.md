## COMP9024 Themes
### Data structures
	
	how to store data inside a computer for efficient use.
	
### Algorithms

	step-by-step process for solving a problem. (within a mount of space and time)

### Array Sorting Algorithms
* https://www.cnblogs.com/onepixel/p/7674659.html
* insertion sorting
* bubble sorting
* merge sorting

### Array Searching Algorithms
* binary search

### Stack and Queue
* stack
* queue
* primary stack and primary queue

### LinkedList Operation and Algorithms
* data structures of Single LinkedList and Double LinkedList
* Init,Insert,Update,Delete,Free,Show
* LinkedList Searching, LinkedList Sorting
* LinkedList Stack and LinkedList Queue

### Analysis Algorithms
* Algorithms Complexity.

### Graph
* Graph Representation
* Graph Searching
* Hamiltonian Path and Circuit(all vertices)
* Euler Path and Circuit(all edges)
* Graph Algorithms(BFS,DFS,Weight Graph,Directed Graph ,Minimum Spanning Trees,Kruskal's Algorithm,Prim's Algorithm,Dijkstra's Algorithm)
* Kruskal's Algorithm (consider all the edges,push to priority queue, then pop from the minimum weighted edge)
* Prim's Algorithm (start from vertex, consider all the minimum edges with the connected vertex,then add to used edges)
* Dijkstra's Algorithm(start from vertex,consider all the minimum edges with the connected vertex, find the combined minimum edges)


### Tree
* init, insert,update, delete, free ,show
* binary tree
* height,width,level
* AVL tree, 2-3-4 Tree

### String Algorithms
